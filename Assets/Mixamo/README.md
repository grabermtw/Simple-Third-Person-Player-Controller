# Basic Third Person Player Controller

1. Import the package.
2. Go to Edit->Project Settings->Player, then under "Other Settings" find "Active Input Handling" beneath "Configuration" and set that to "Both." This will allow you to use the traditional input system (for example, "Input.GetKey()") in addition to the new input system that this third person player controller uses.
